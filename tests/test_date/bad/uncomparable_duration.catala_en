## `UncomparableDurations` exception management

### `<` operator

```catala
declaration scope Lt:
  context d content boolean

scope Lt:
  definition d equals 1 month < 2 day
```

### `<=` operator

```catala
declaration scope Le:
  context d content boolean

scope Le:
  definition d equals 1 month <= 2 day
```

### `<=` operator

```catala
declaration scope Gt:
  context d content boolean

scope Gt:
  definition d equals 1 month > 2 day
```

### `>=` operator

```catala
declaration scope Ge:
  context d content boolean

scope Ge:
  definition d equals 1 month >= 2 day
```

```catala-test-inline
$ catala Interpret -s Ge
