## Law text should be able to contain grave accent '`'.

This is a block of law text containing `.
This allows to:

* use `Markdown` code block inside `Catala` files,

* _escape_ special characters such as `#` or `>`,

* use Fenced Code Blocks:

```
let () = print_endline "Hello world!"
```

**Remark**: for Fenced Code Blocks, ``` must be followed by a space or a new line.

```catala
new scope A:
  param literate_parsing_is_ok content bool

scope A:
  def literate_parsing_is_ok := true
```

Even after `Catala` code block.
