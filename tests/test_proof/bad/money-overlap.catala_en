## Test

Overlap when x = $1000

```catala
declaration scope A:
  context x content money
  context y content boolean

scope A:
  definition x equals $20,000
  definition y under condition x <= $1,000 consequence equals true
  definition y under condition x >= $1,000 and x < $10,000 consequence equals false
  definition y under condition x >= $10,000 and x < $100,000 consequence equals true
  definition y under condition x >= $100,000 consequence equals false
```
